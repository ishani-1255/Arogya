- **Drug Interaction Detection**: Identifies potential harmful interactions between medications
- **Patient & Doctor Information Recognition**: Extracts and organizes patient demographics and physician credentials
- **Possible Disease Inference**: Analyzes prescribed medications to suggest potential underlying conditions

### 2. Diagnostic Assistant
- **Symptom-Based Analysis**: Evaluates symptoms to identify possible medical conditions with corresponding urgency levels
- **Medical Image Analysis**: Processes X-rays, MRIs, and other medical imagery to detect abnormalities
- **Lab Report Interpretation**: Analyzes lab results to identify abnormal values and provide actionable insights
- **Image Enhancement Options**: Provides noise reduction, contrast boosting, and edge enhancement to improve medical image clarity

### 3. Early Cancer Detection
- **AI-Powered Detection Models**: Implements deep learning algorithms to identify early signs of cancer from medical images
- **Federated Learning Integration**: Uses distributed machine learning across institutions while preserving patient privacy
- **Multimodal Analysis**: Combines different data types to improve detection accuracy
- **Clinical Workflow Integration**: Seamlessly fits into existing healthcare workflows as a supplementary diagnostic tool

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React.js with Tailwind CSS for responsive, modern UI
- Recharts for data visualization
- Lucide for icons and UI elements

### Backend
- Flask with Python for the API server
- Google's Generative AI (Gemini 1.5 Flash) for medical text and image analysis
- OpenCV and PIL for advanced image processing and enhancement
- Custom LangChain pipelines for complex medical document processing

### AI & ML Components
- **OCR Pipeline**: Custom-built OCR system optimized for medical documents and prescriptions
- **Medical Image Processing**: Specialized algorithms for enhancing and analyzing different types of medical imagery
- **NLP for Medical Text**: Fine-tuned language models for medical terminology extraction and analysis
- **Vector Database Integration**: For efficient similar case retrieval and comparison

## Implementation Details

### AI-Powered Document Analysis
Arogya utilizes a sophisticated document analysis pipeline that combines OCR with specialized medical language models. The system:

1. **Preprocesses Images**: Enhances image quality through adaptive thresholding and noise reduction
2. **Performs Region-Specific OCR**: Uses specialized recognition for different sections of medical documents
3. **Applies Medical NER**: Identifies medications, dosages, and medical terms with high accuracy
4. **Contextual Understanding**: Interprets medical abbreviations and shorthand based on context

### Medical Insight Generation
The system employs several AI models working in concert:

1. **Symptom-Condition Mapping**: Trained on large medical datasets to match symptoms to potential conditions
2. **Medical Image Analysis**: Utilizes segmentation and classification models to identify abnormalities
3. **Lab Value Interpretation**: Compares values against reference ranges with consideration for patient demographics
4. **Cross-Referencing Engine**: Validates findings across multiple knowledge sources for increased reliability

### Data Privacy & Security
- End-to-end encryption for all user data
- Compliance with healthcare data regulations
- Federated learning approach to minimize data exposure
- No persistent storage of sensitive medical information
